# Things To Do

## Simplistic UI Rewrite

Can probably remove Sass preprocessor and go for pure CSS. This will keep development simpler and allow viewing CSS changes quickly on page refresh instead of waiting for compilation. Should take note on the color scheme to reuse as variables.

Not sure if Redux is needed for state management as there are not many complex UI changes, can get away with React state hooks.

## Responsive Layouts

Page layout doesn't look great on screens smaller than a desktop monitor. Should probably work on this first to test different designs with mock content.

## Better Pagination UX

Proper pagination instead of infinite scrolling would be easier to use.

## Orbital Visualizations

Perhaps use something like Three.js to display orbits of Near-Earth objects using the fetched data.
