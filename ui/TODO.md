# Things To Do

## Simplistic UI Rewrite

Can keep Sass and Redux but add tests for components using Storybook. Consider looking into island architecture.

## Responsive Layouts

Page layout doesn't look great on screens smaller than a desktop monitor. Should probably work on this first to test different designs with mock content.

UI loaders for components while waiting for data to be fetched and loaded.

## Better Pagination UX

Proper pagination instead of infinite scrolling would be easier to use.

## Orbital Visualizations

Perhaps use something like Three.js to display orbits of Near-Earth objects using the fetched data.
